# Horiseon-code-cleanup

## Description

This website was reworked in hopes of making it more user friendly and accessible to others who may need to add or change details in the code. I removed outdated div tags and replaced them with HTML semanitic elements. This should make it easier to navigate the different sections of the website. While working on this I was able to apply the different concepts learned these past few days of class. It was interesting debugging code I broke and trying to figure out why it had broke. I also now feel more comfortable in knowing and seeing how using different selectors affects the css style sheet.
